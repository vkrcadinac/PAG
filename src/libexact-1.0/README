libexact v1.0
=============


libexact is a software library for solving combinatorial 
exact covering problems; a detailed User's Guide can
be found in the accompanying PDF file "guide.pdf".


Getting the latest version
--------------------------

The latest version of libexact can be downloaded from 
the web page <http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/pkaski/libexact/>.


Compiling
---------

The library and the accompanying executables should compile 
on most modern UNIX (Linux) systems simply by running 
the command "make". An honest attempt has been made 
to make the library source code conform to the 
ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard (C99). 

To compile manually, the main library routines reside in 
the file "exact.c", which must be linked with the utility 
functions in "util.c" to obtain a functional library. 
The public interface to the library is declared in "exact.h". 


Testing the library
-------------------

After compilation, it is strongly recommended that the
library is tested by running the test executable "test".
Please note that some of the tests take some time to 
complete.


Examples
--------

Example code illustrating the use of the library 
can be found in the directory "examples". 


Command-line interface
----------------------

The executable "solve", documented in the User's Guide, 
provides a plain command-line interface to the library.
